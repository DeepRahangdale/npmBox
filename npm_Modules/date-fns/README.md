# It's like [Lodash](https://lodash.com) for dates

- It has [**200+ functions** for all occasions](https://date-fns.org/docs/Getting-Started/).
- **Modular**: Pick what you need. Works with webpack, Browserify, or Rollup and also supports tree-shaking.
- **Native dates**: Uses existing native type. It doesn't extend core objects for safety's sake.
- **Immutable & Pure**: Built using pure functions and always returns a new date instance.
- **TypeScript & Flow**: Supports both Flow and TypeScript
- **I18n**: Dozens of locales. Include only what you need.
- [and many more benefits](https://date-fns.org/)

The library is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns).
To install the package run:

```bash
npm install date-fns --save
# or with yarn
yarn add date-fns
```
